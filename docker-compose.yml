# Define the services (containers) for your application

  # This service is for the Angular development environment

    # Map port 4200 on the host to port 4200 in the container
    ports:
      - "4200:4200"
    
    # Mount the current directory on the host machine to the /app directory in the container
    # This is crucial for live reloading, as it syncs your local code changes to the container
    # We also create a separate anonymous volume for `node_modules` to avoid permission issues
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules

    # Ensure the container is restarted if it stops unexpectedly
    restart: always

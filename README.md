# EMedicHubWeb

This font-end project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.4.

## Development server

[Recommended]Start local development server using docker.

Install Docker for your machine.
Run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

[Using Vite] To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## GIT workflow

Tested, well formatted code (Use Prettier) is to be pushed to their respective `feature` or `bugfix` branches.
Branch names and commit messages should start with the JIRA ID.

Examples:

Branch Name -- feature/KAN-123_sample_branchName_camelCase
Commit Message -- KAN-123: This is a sample commit message. A quick brown fox doesn't jump over dogs very often

PR should be approved by atleast 1 member before branch can be merged to 'Main'

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests (currently not setup)

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
